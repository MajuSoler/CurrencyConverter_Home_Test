# Currency Converter

This is a currency converter project done as a home test for a Front End position. 

Users can choose a currency and a value and convert it to other coins. The date can also be changed.

React, JavaScript and CSS are used in the FrontEnd and Redux is used as state container.
Axios was used to make HTTP requests.

In the future, other features can be added, such as a flag for the country of each currency or bidirectional conversion
